Proof of concept to see if Multi-Peer Connectivity framework will meet app requirements for syncing data without any internet connectivity using bluetooth

## Screenshot

There is only one screen.
If you run the app on two devices close to each other the data will be sent from one to the other:

## Operation

This app will send data to any other device in range (connected via bluetooth) running this app. There are no confirmation popups.
